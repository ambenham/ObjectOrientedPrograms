# ObjectOrientedPrograms

Here is a collection of ten console programs constructed with Java, using Eclipse IDE. These programs are based on object-oriented programming and complete a variety of tasks, those being:

1. Display different escape sequences in a table.
2. Use user input to calculate the circumference and the area of a circle.
3. Assign a user's grade based on their score.
4. Check for duplicate colours based on the contents of two arrays.
5. Calculate the total duration of music notes, based on a list of note instances
6. Based on a list of vegetable instances, calculate the total weight of each vegetable type and total cost of all vegetables.
7. Print a list of shape instances. Then, based on the contents of two arrays containing rectangle instances, count the number of overlapping colours and perimeters.
8. Based on a list of bag instances, calculate the total capacity and number of bags.
9. A guessing game where the player guesses the capital city of a given country, using file input.
10. Using file input, based on a list of audiobook instances, complete the following:
    - Find the shortest book in the list.
    - Count the number of books published between the given year range.
    - Randomly sort the books into one of three lists.
